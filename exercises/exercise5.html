            <h1> ABOUT ME - Victor Chen </h1>
            <h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
            <p> 
                My name is Victor Chen. I am a senior Informatics major with a concentration in Data Science and a minor in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. 
                I will be working at Travelers in their Business Insights & Analytics Leadership Development Program following my graduation in June 2023. 
                Right now, my focus is on becoming the best data professional I can, however I am also interested in Web Development and may hope to shift into that field some day.   
            </p>

            <h2> SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE </h2>
            <p>
                My professional skills revolve mostly around general programming and programming for data analytics and data science, including proficiency in Jupyter Notebook/Pandas (Python), RStudio, SQL, Databricks, Tableau/MicroStrategy, C, Java and much more.  
                The analytics projects portion of this website will detail some of my most notable explorative analytics projects throughout my academic experience at UMass Amherst, aswell as my internship at Travelers during Summer 2022. 
                I am also currently taking Web Programming and Introduction to Web Design at UMass and will be working on many website/web application projects in the near future including this one.
            </p>

            <h2> FUN FACTS </h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in Sherborn, Massachusetts with my parents, little brother, and many chickens. My favorite TV show is Attack On Titan and my favorite musician is Tyler, the Creator. 
                In my free time I enjoy watching NBA basketball (I am a Celtics fan) and building / learning about custom gaming PCs.
